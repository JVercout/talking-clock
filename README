# Talking Clock - Multilingual Time Announcement

This project provides a talking clock that announces the current time in French, English, German, and Italian. It uses pre-recorded audio files and assembles them dynamically based on the current time.

## Supported Languages & Their Specificities

### [1] French (fr)
- Uses "Il est" at the beginning of the sentence.
- Uses "heures" after the hour

### [2] English (en)
- Uses "It is" at the beginning.
- Uses "o'clock" for full hours.
- Special cases:
  - 15 minutes past → "quarter past"
  - 30 minutes past → "half past"
  - 45 minutes past → "quarter to"
  - Minutes greater than 30 use "to" with the next hour (e.g., 8:50 → "It is ten to nine.")

### 3️⃣ German (de)
- Uses "Es ist" at the beginning.
- Uses "Uhr" after the hour for full hours.
- Special cases:
  - 15 minutes past → "Viertel nach"
  - 30 minutes past → "halb" with the next hour
  - 45 minutes past → "Viertel vor"
  - Minutes greater than 30 use "vor" with the next hour (e.g., 8:50 → "Es ist zehn vor neun.")

### 4️⃣ Italian (it)
- Uses "È" at the beginning.
- Uses "le" for most hours except 1:00, which uses "l'" (e.g., "È l'una" instead of "È le uno").
- Uses "ore" after the hour unless it is noon (mezzogiorno) or midnight (mezzanotte).
- Special cases:
  - 12:00 → "È mezzogiorno."
  - 00:00 → "È mezzanotte."
  - 15 minutes past → "e un quarto"
  - 30 minutes past → "e mezza"
  - 45 minutes past → "meno un quarto"
  - Minutes greater than 30 use "meno" with the next hour (e.g., 8:50 → "È le nove meno dieci.")

## How It Works
- The script determines the current time and selects the appropriate audio files.
- It concatenates them smoothly and plays the final announcement.
- Each language follows its natural way of telling time.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the required audio files in the `audio/` directory.
2. Run the script and choose a language: `python talking_clock.py`
3. The script will play the time announcement in the selected language.

Enjoy your multilingual talking clock! 🎙️⏰
